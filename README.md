[![Download CloudPipe](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-CloudPipe-blue.svg)](https://github.com/leonadolfsson/CloudPipe-Automated-ETL-Pipeline-on-AWS/releases)

## 📋 Overview

CloudPipe is a fully automated, serverless ETL pipeline on AWS. It simplifies data processing by ingesting raw data, transforming it using AWS Glue, and storing the results in S3. You can easily query the processed data with Athena. The pipeline runs automatically, sends notifications through SNS, and is monitored using CloudWatch and EventBridge.

## ⚙️ Features

- **Automated Data Ingestion**: Automatically gather raw data from various sources.
- **Data Transformation**: Uses AWS Glue to clean and transform data.
- **Storage**: Saves processed data securely in Amazon S3.
- **Querying**: Allows for easy querying with Amazon Athena.
- **Monitoring**: Keeps track of your processes with CloudWatch.
- **Notifications**: Sends alerts and updates through Amazon SNS.
